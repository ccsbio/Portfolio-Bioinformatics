# Portfolio Bioinformatics  
Welcome, my name is Carla Casanova Su√°rez and I studied the MSc in Bioinformatics from the Autonomous University of Barcelona. Moreover, I studied the Genomics specialization. The present repository shows some of the scripts and the omics data analyses that I performed during my MSc degree.  

On the one hand, some Python scripts have been included for analyzing FASTA and FASTQ files containing genomic sequences. Two files, one FASTA and one FASTQ, have been included in the `Test files` directory for testing the Python tools of this repository. On the other hand, some PDF's with omics data analysis have been included in a different directory. These analyses were performed with R and they show the whole script used during the analysis in the **Appendix**, since these documents were R Markdown.  

Hope you find this repository helpful to gain more insight into my profile.  

Regards!
