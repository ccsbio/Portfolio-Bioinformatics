# Python tools for omics data analysis  
This repository contains some of the scripts that I had to program for analyzing FASTA and FASTQ files, which are common file formats containing genomic sequences.  

The instructions for each program are detailed at the beginning of the Python script (the file with the extension .py). Moreover, the directories found are also Python tools that need dependencies, which are all available within the directory. In these cases, the instructions are written in the README.md file.
